Reflection  

How do I approach designing software?
    I try to go through the bullet points of needs systematically to make sure the software covers all requirements. 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
   This was my first graphic design project so all of the skills are new.  I learned to manipulate basic meshes, apply textures, create materials that interact with light, apply lighting and camera movement with user input. 
What design process did you follow for your project work?
  I worked to meet all requirements while also creating the feel of the image or scene I was attempting to create. 
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
  I like working systematically as it ensures all requirements are met.  It is a good starting point.  As my education in this field grows that work flow may change to become more streamlined and faster.  
How do I approach developing programs?
  The same way I approach developing software, systematically work through what the program is required to do, then work on making improvements. 
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
  I developed the strategy of making sure the images work from all angles. I flexed problem solving muscles when the lighting didn't work as intended and had to be modified for the scene.  
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
  The milestones really helped break the project into smaller more managable piece that we could focus on for the week's "sprint". It allowed for greater understanding as we concentrated on one specific aspect for each week.  Submitting the milestone allowed for feedback that could then be applied back to the project, improving the quality as we went. 
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  Computers are guiding the current world function and are used in almost all fields.  There are an infinite number of ways the computer sciences can help anyone reach goals. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
  Manipulating the vectors for each mesh to get the intended result really developed applying vector and matrix math to real world situations which I believe will help create a solid foundation as I move forward in the this educational pathway. 
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
  The skills acquired in this course will be applied in my future professional pathway as our current society relies heavily on visual appeal.  This means all applicatons or games that render with high quality are favored and more successful.  This course really laid foundation for creating quality images and scenes.
